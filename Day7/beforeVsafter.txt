✅ Direct Answer

Yes.
In nested describe blocks:

Child afterEach runs BEFORE parent afterEach.

🔁 Correct Hook Order (Per Test)

For a test inside a nested describe, Jest runs hooks in this exact order:

Parent beforeEach
Child beforeEach
Test
Child afterEach   ✅
Parent afterEach  ✅


So cleanup happens from inner → outer.

🧠 Why Does Jest Do This?

Think of it like stack unwinding or resource cleanup:

🔹 beforeEach = setup

Parent sets up shared/global state

Child sets up specific/local state

🔹 afterEach = cleanup (reverse order)

Child cleans up what it created

Parent cleans up what it created

This prevents:

Leaks

Invalid state

Parent cleanup breaking child logic

👉 This follows the same principle as:

try → finally

Call stack execution

Nested transactions

📌 Simple Analogy (Very Interview-Friendly)

“beforeEach runs outside → inside,
afterEach runs inside → outside.”
